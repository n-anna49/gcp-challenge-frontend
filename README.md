# GCP Challenge Frontend
The following files consist of the frontend portion of the GCP challenge. The index.html is the home page, along with resume.css for some CSS styling. The counter.js fetches the API in the backend to display the visitor count. Finally, the cloudbuild.yaml updates the cloud storage bucket any time code is pushed to this repository.
